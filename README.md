# Fase1
A stupid low cost extension to make variations in-seed.

**What is Fase1?** Fase1 is a script to generate a sequence of images from weird symbols of my keyboard.\
**Why does this trick work?** Because all the language models use word stems. So if you include random variations in one word it will not change their embedding.\
**When did you discover it?** It was one of the first thing I tried when SD 1.4 was released.\
**How can I create videos?** Fase1 is a draft for now. You can generate gifs or videos with ImageMagick, ffmpeg or web services.\
**Where?** Only for Automatic1111.

**Contribute** Please share your ideas to improve this extension. If you find other modifiers: Kanjis, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Amazigh, emojis... or you want optimize the code send me your issues or pull requests.

## Quick Start

*	Go to extensions tab
*	Click in section "Install from URL"
*	Paste https://github.com/jisqrt/Fase1.git and click Install
*	Restart the Web UI
*	Be happy

## How to use

1. Write a prompt and generate your image.
2. Click on recycle the last seed.
3. Activate the extension.
4. Use the first slider to select a word of your prompt (count the position).
5. On section Modifiers choose one of them, with the slider select the number of iterations of that modifier. If you want play with others options.
6. Press Generate and wait.
7. Read the wiki for more info.

- [ ] Experiments with external c++ library for Fase2
- [ ] Profits (not really)
